LIST OF MOST COMMON WORDS

This file contains words that most commonly occur in juvenile reading matter. There are eight lists comprising around 225 words. These words probably cover around three-quarters of all juvenile reading. There are different versions of common word lists. This version of such lists comes from Dolch. Read w300readme.txt to see another version.

WRITING YOUR OWN WORD LISTS
Registered users can simply compile a wordlist with a simple text editor such as the one called "Write" or "Wordpad" that comes with Win95, and save it in the program's directory as a _text file_ with the extension .txt and it will appear for use in the wordlist selector. 

A user must be careful when compiling wordlists in that no extra spaces should be accidentally placed at the end of words in a list (as the program will assume these are part of the correct spelling). If a user
simply presses ENTER after typing the last letter of a word, all will be OK. The only exception to this is when a wordlist contains entries that have more than one word, e.g., "the house is there"; "their house". However, even when multiple words are entered, there should be no space left behind the last word.
