GRADE WORD LISTS

These word lists have been converted to conform to US English usage.

These lists may be regarded as a minimum list of words that children may reasonable be expected to use in their writing as they progress through the elementary school years.

The lists are divided into separate yearly lists to represent the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth primary school years. For convenience, each yearly lists is sub-divided alphabetically.

To use the lists in the program, save them in the same directory where Personal Best Spelling is installed. They will then come up for selection in the wordlist selector.

WRITING YOUR OWN WORD LISTS
Registered users can simply compile a wordlist with a simple text editor such as the one called "Write" or "Wordpad" that comes with Win95/98/NT, and save it in the program's directory as a _text file_ with the extension .txt and it will appear for use in the wordlist selector. 

A user must be careful when compiling wordlists in that no extra spaces should be accidentally placed at the end of words in a list (as the program will assume these are part of the correct spelling). If a user
simply presses ENTER after typing the last letter of a word, all will be OK. The only exception to this is when a wordlist contains entries that have more than one word, e.g., "the house is there"; "their house". However, even when multiple words are entered, there should be no space left behind the last word.
