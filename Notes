1) do not mispronounce words to "sound" like correct spelling
   visualize word with correct sounds and letter correspondences.

The syllabication of a word does not allways correspond the phonemes.
For example sufficient => suf.fi.cient => /s@-fish'@nt/. In the 
syllabication the ff is split but the first sounded syllable does not
have an /f/ sound.

I seem to be able to spell better when I'm not watching my writing or
typing.  Seeing the letters tends to mix me up.
